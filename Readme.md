#Computation of Auger process threshold energy

The simple OpenCL & pure C programm written to E_{th}
for three-particle processes in HgCdTe semiconductors.

Now it works but deprecated because of lack of stability.

It was tested on MacOS X with clang-1001.0.46.3. Theoretically
it should work on every platform that supports OpenCL.

P.S.: CVMCompiler is pretty awful - it crashes 1 time
out of 3.

P.P.S.: Someone can find my implementation of cubic splines 
and conjugate gradient useful.
