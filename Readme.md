#Computation of Auger process threshold energy

The simple OpenCL & pure C programm written to E_{th}
for three-particle processes in HgCdTe semiconductors.

Now it works but deprecated because of lack of stability.

P.S.: CVMCompiler is pretty awful - it crashes 1 time 
out of 3.

P.P.S.: Anyone can find my implementation of cubic splines 
and conjugate gradient useful.
